# esclient
ElasticSearch Java Client - strongly typed using Gson

# Alternatives

There are two other alternatives to this library.

* Official ElaticSearch Java Client - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/index.html
* Jest - https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest

The only drawback with both of them was that they provided a lot of flexibility and thus were not very strongly-typed. Like, 
creating an index was not straightforward.
